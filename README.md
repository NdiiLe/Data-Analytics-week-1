5. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
   
• Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,

• Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

7. Decision Support:

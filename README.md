What is DATA ANALYSIS
It is the process of systematically collecting, cleaning, transforming, describing, modeling, and interpreting data, generally employing statistical techniques.

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

• Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,

• Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

2. Data Analysis:
   
• Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,

• Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
   
• Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,

• Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

4. Decision Support:

• Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,

• Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

5. Collaboration and Communication:
    
• Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,

• Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders,

6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:
    
• Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.

• Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.


Data analysts are the professionals who possess the skills and knowledge required to perform this vital work. 
They understand how the organization can acquire, clean, and transform data to meet the organization's needs.


MAJOR PILLARS OF ANALYTICS

We have 3 major pillars and those are:

• Data

• Storage

• Computing

THE ANALYTIC PROCESS

Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data.

Data Acquisition
Cleaning and Manipulation
Analysis
Visualization
Reporting and Communication

The Analytics Process is Iterative

The analytics process is a series of interrelated actions that can be revisited frequently. An analyst may go back to data cleaning if unusual data points are found, or return to data acquisition if additional sources are needed. This process helps understand the activities in data analysis and their typical order, but should be viewed as a flexible guide rather than a strict sequence.

Analytics Techniques

Analysts use a variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.

Descriptive Analytics
Predictive Analytics
Prescriptive Analytics

Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning

The field of analytics can be challenging, but there are automated techniques available to help unlock hidden value in data. Machine learning, which uses algorithms to discover knowledge in datasets, can be applied to various fields to make informed decisions about the future. Examples of how machine learning adds value include segmenting customers for targeted marketing, detecting anomalies in system logs for cybersecurity, forecasting product sales, recommending movies based on past activity, and setting prices based on demand forecasts.

Artificial intelligence (AI) involves computer systems imitating human behavior, while machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that applies statistics to discover new knowledge. Deep learning is a more complex subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to analyze images, videos, and sound.

Understanding these terms is crucial as they are often used interchangeably in the field of data analysis. While computers may not be capable of human-level reasoning, techniques like machine learning and deep learning can still be used to simulate intelligent behavior and discover valuable insights from data.

  DATA GOVERNANCE
  
Data governance maintains data quality, security, and availability through policies, determining ownership, security measures, and usage.
 
Exploring Data Types

Tabular Data

Tabular data is organized into columns and rows, representing information about a single topic. Each column in a table represents a unique field or variable, while each row represents a record of a single instance of the topic. For example, in a pet data table, the columns may include information such as pet name, breed, birth date, height, and weight. The intersection of a row and column contains specific values, such as identifying a pet's breed.

Tabular data can be easily represented in a rectangular format, with columns defining the top of the rectangle and rows on the left side. Spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel and databases like Oracle or MySQL are practical tools for working with tabular data. Databases organize related data across multiple tables, with connections between tables known as relationships. Overall, tabular data is the foundation for both spreadsheets and relational databases.
